Welcome to Sibyl. This is an application that catalogs all single-layer, multi-layer, and tapered extrusions within Maple Grove Core Technology Polymers (CTP). The catalog comprises all commercial components and some pre-commercial components. This tool is intended to decrease development time by providing access to reliable and extensive data regarding CTP’s commercial components. Teams can identify current extruded components that closely align with their component needs, determine how those components run on production, and analyze the process capabilities and yields.
